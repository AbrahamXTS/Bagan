### Scrum roles
- **Product owner:** The Product Owner is in charge of optimising and maximising the value of the product. His or her work as an interlocutor with stakeholders and project sponsors is fundamental, as well as his or her role as a loudspeaker for customer requests and requirements.
- **Scrum master:** The Scrum Master has two main roles: to manage the Scrum process and to help remove impediments that may affect product delivery.
- **Development team:** It's the team in charge of developing the product, self-managing to deliver a software increment at the end of the development cycle.
